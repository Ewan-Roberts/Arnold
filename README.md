My first step into an exciting new world of a up and coming programming language:

```
"YOU SET US UP MATE STICK AROUND LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR PLEASE"+ 
	"ENOUGH TALK IT'S SHOWTIME"+
			"TALK TO THE HAND GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR PLEASE ENOUGH TALK" +
		"HASTA LA VISTA BABY" +
	"TERMINATED MATE" +
	"GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR"+ 

	"'GET TO THE CHOPPA!'" +

"ENOUGH TALK"	
```
