My first step into an exciting new world of a up and coming programming language:

```
"YOU SET US UP MATE STICK AROUND LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY "+ 

	"GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR PLEASE"+ 
		
		"ENOUGH TALK IT'S SHOWTIME"+
			
		"TALK TO THE HAND GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR PLEASE ENOUGH TALK" +
				
			"HASTA LA VISTA BABY" +
			"TERMINATED MATE" +
		
		"GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR"+ 
	
	"'GET TO THE CHOPPA!'" +
	
"ENOUGH TALK"

"TALK TO THE HAND GIVE THESE PEOPLE AIR" +
	
	"YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR LOGIC!"+ 

"ENOUGH TALK"	

```
